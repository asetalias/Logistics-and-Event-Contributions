TL;DR.â€‹ Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. If you are in a situation that
makes you uncomfortable at an officially sanctioned MLH event, if the event itself is creating
an unsafe or inappropriate environment, or if interacting with a MLH representative or event
organizer makes you uncomfortable, please report it using the procedures included in this
