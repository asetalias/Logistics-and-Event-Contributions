### [Spirit](http://bit.ly/2DX0f7S)
The Hacker Spirit is about learning and teaching. They are a great opportunity to learn new things and meet new friends. Remember, asking for help is okay! Offer help and constructive feedback when you can.You should endeavour to build something at the event. Show people what you managed to get built, and tell people what you learned! What matters is that you attempted to build something — that’s the true Hacker Spirit!
Teams should communicate, be friendly to each other, and work together. You’ll get a lot more from the event by working with other teams than by trying to work against them. Teams are encouraged to offer help and advice to each other.
