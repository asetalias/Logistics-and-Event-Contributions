## About speaker

Sahil Jha is the speaker for the event. His interests include Internet of Things and game development. 
He has developed a game for android devices called [CubeBox](https://github.com/sjha2000/CubeBox). His various projects in IoT include smart speaker 
and home automation devices. 

## About event

During the event, Sahil Jha and Vipul Goyal introduced the audience with Raspberry Pi and its application in IoT.
Such applications helped the audience realise how amazing it is to see that only a few years back, it was virtually 
impossible for someone to have access to actual hardware to run IoT solutions. Solutions, that are cheap and 
reasonably-sized equipment that you culd easily deploy in a house, a car, or anywhere else. Nowadays, platforms 
like Arduino, mbed, BeagleBone and Raspberry Pi are providing IoT developers with a wide ecosystem of hardware that 
can be used to easily prototype and even go to production for small batches.

Audience was guided through writing code for Raspberry Pi from the basics to the demonstrations on the projects:
- Giving variable and digital output through touch sensor via LED lights,
- Switched controller buzzer, and
- Output via humidity and temperature sensors
